                        Articulate, Inquisitive, and Analytical. I am a Data Analyst, Energy Engineering graduate, and Chemical Engineering Technologist. I love data and I love machines. What do I do? I design and simulate energy systems such wind farms, solar farms, and natural gas power plants and optimize them. I use tools such a SAM to simulate renewable energy systems and AspenHYSYS to develop process simulations for conventional fuel. In this portfolio you will find details of my education, experiences, projects and other fun stuff I have been up to. Enjoy!

                                This research internship took place under the supervision of Dr. Joule Bergerson sponsored by Alberta Innovates. The project investigated energy storage and CO2 conversion to fuels using novel nanomaterials. My focus was to perform a Life Cycle Assessment using ISO 14044 of catalyst LCFCr which was developed at University of Calgary.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                For context, LCFCr is an electrocatalyst used in SOFC (solid-oxide fuel cells) that facilitates the conversion of CO2 to syngas (and syngas to CO2 as it is a reversible catalyst). Currently the LCA studies published on SOFC fuel cells did not include catalyst extraction and synthesis emissions in their assessment. It is important to have a robust analysis of catalysts used in fuel cells as they require rare earth metals and a very energy intensive synthesis. An excel model was developed for the LCA. A sensitivity analysis was also carried out for factors such as batch size and grid emission intensity. Similar methodology was also applied on other catalysts such as BSFAl, Ni-LSCeCrF, and NSCF and compared from an environmental and cost perspective.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A secondary objective of this research was to simulate and scale up the synthesis of the catalyst to better understand commercialization impact. In order to understand the synthesis, I carried out extensive literature search, using scientific articles and patents. The simulation and scale-up was performed on AspenPlus. I communicated findings, challenges, recommendations, and alternative emission estimation and synthesis techniques in a formal report and presentation to Dr. Joule.

                                Working with Dr. Budiman on the “Self-Balancing Unicycle” was a fascinating experience. It was the first time I witnessed a professor in his element trying to do something no one has ever done before. After 3-years of math, Dr. Budiman came up with a series of dynamic equations that predicted the motion of a single-wheeled robot. So far only linearized kinematic models have been developed. He further explains it in his paper “Stability Control Mechanisms and Stable Rectilinear Solution of Unicycle Motion” which I do not understand a word of. My objective was to prove his equations worked. And the best way to do that is to develop a prototype. After several discussions I started working modelling it on SolidWorks. I created drawings and simulations and we went back-and forth for a while till we decided to manufacture it. The best way to manufacture a prototype these days is to 3D print it. Simultaneous I carried out equipment sizing and selection and programmed the Arduino based motor control system.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The 1st iteration was not successful. But Dr. Budiman was very happy that we moved several steps forward in making his dream come true. Below is a picture of the engineering drawing and a build model.

                            In this summer job I assisted J.E.D. Anchors & Environmental Ltd. to receive tax credits for the development of an innovative hybrid drill rig intended for geotechnical and environmental drilling. I performed site observations and transcribed technical interview discussion. The objective was to prove to the CRA that the research and development conducted by the company was indeed novel. I successfully outlined the technological advancements made and the obstacles overcame in the final report. Below is the image of their second prototype.

                        <div>Energy Engineering combined my technical knowledge from SAIT with a deep insight into theoretics. This transformed me from a unidimensional technologist into a multidimensional engineer. We explored the full energy life cycle: extraction, production, conversion, refining, transmission and distribution for petroleum and renewable technologies. I aquired skills such as energy modelling for wind and solar plants using SAM and RETScreen, Life Cycle Assesment for various chemical processes, learning PLC programming using vBuilder, chemical plant capital cost estimation using Aspen Capital Cost estimator and circuit design and development. We also stuided non-technical courses such as Project Management where we looked at Ethics and Legality, Project Planning, Risk Management, Scheduling, Profitability Analysis, Project Control and Closure.
                            <br> For my Technical Elective I took HVAC (heating, ventilating, and air conditioning) systems, this gave me the skills understand and develop building energy models using eQuest. Combined with my LEED Green Associate certification I can entre the world of sustainable building design and operation.

                            My main motivation for becoming a chemical engineering technologist was that ut would expose me to lots of cool machines. This in fact turned out to be the case. I operated, monitored, and analyzed heat exchangers (shell-tube, aerial, plate), pumps, distillation columns, compressors, amine sweeteners, evaporators, and flowmeters.
                            <br> Trained in AspenHYSYS and HTRI Xchanger Suite® was almost like playing an advanced chemical engineering video game. I simulated refrigeration cycles, distillation systems, gas sweeteners, sulfur recovery units, dehydrators, compressor trains, pipeflow, and combustion units. I wish there was a student version of AspenHYSYS so I could keep playing around with it.
                            <br> For 4 months we had the opportunity to study, monitor, and operate a fully functional wellsite. It was facinating to see all the units such as separators, heaters, compressors, dehydrators come together and process oil and gas.
                            <br> Near the end of my study came the analytics, here we performed laboratory & industrial chemical analysis using spectrometry, chromatography, and atomic absorption instruments. We also erformed water analysis for pH, alkalinity, hardness, TDS, turbidity etc. In the gallery bellow you will see these cool equipment.
                            <br> I also received education in Occupational Health & Safety and certification for WHMIS and TDGs.

By completing literature reviews and making assumptions and correlations between data, this study quantifies the impact of e-scooters on the global warming potential, measured in kg CO2e/passenger km in Calgary.

                    I love to cook for fun. Food to me is the most immersive art form to exist. The eating experience encapsulates all five senses. A colourful, sizzling, velvety, aromatic, spicy meal to me is better than a tour of any art museum. I am self-taught so that means I do a lot of experimentation, most of them are failed experiments. Below are some of the dishes I have made.

            <p>
                3d Printers are my 4th favourite invention in the world. Right after fire, anaesthesia, and the transistor. I ordered a kit from Shenzhen, China and spent the next week assembling it myself. It was the most (in hindsight) fun experience ever. I understood where every part went and what its function was. I made toys, art pieces, and functional prints (mostly toys though). My first ever print was a cube - I designed and printed a 10mm x 10mm x 10mm calibrtion cube. It was meant to check how well the 3d printer was tuned. I used electronic calipers to check if the cube was the same size as I designed it. It usually isn't and mine was not either. Below you will find some pictures I took during the assembly phase.
